🌐 In this project, I've harnessed the capabilities of Flask to create a seamless web experience for managing tasks. The application allows you to:

Add new tasks
Update task details
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks
Retrieve the list of tasks
💡 By utilizing the Flask framework, I've designed RESTful API endpoints to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to interact with the application. The back end leverages Flask's capabilities to handle routes, data storage, and API interactions.
